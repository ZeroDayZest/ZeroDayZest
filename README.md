- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZeroDayZest
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in digital forensics, investigation, incident repsonse, white collar crime and missing persons. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OSINT techniques.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I found myself in my degree program after working as a Private Investigator, while running my hair salon. Turns out, I'm really good at finding people, 
 finding out about people, AND doing hair.
